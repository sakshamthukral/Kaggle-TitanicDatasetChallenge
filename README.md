# Kaggle-TitanicDatasetChallenge
Implementing Titanic Data set problem of Kaggle using DECISION TREES AND RANDOM FORESTS.
The MODEL have been completly trained on DECISION TREES AND RANDOM FORESTS seprately .
Since the Test data of kaggle required some formal informations, so i trained and tested the model on the train data only.
But If you want the complete project using train and test files then you can reffer to 'Titanic2' project.Although the train.csv and the test.csv of kaggle might be different fromt those of thr train and test file used for the Titanic2 project, but all the steps are exactly same , u just need to change the file location and add the train and test files of kaggle , you wil recieve the correct outcome :)
